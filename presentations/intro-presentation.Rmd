- ~ [1 hour lecture by volunteers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S63IHjNBk8e7St6XcyqhVu98qpuRTUx3DHYqzWKYDys/edit)

- ~ 2 hour hands-on activities

- Come to class prepared!
  - We'll send out materials beforehand
  
- If you're not teaching, find a section to help with

- Learning & community, not expertise!

# Getting the Materials

# Accessing Lecture Materials

We're going to use GitHub for this class
  - Apologies to team BitBucket
  - Principles helpful either way!
  - One repo per lecture
  - All materials needed to recreate materials in repo

"Best" way to get materials
  - Create class folder on your machine
  - Fork repo to your github account
  - Clone to the folder on your computer
  - Rebase from master to get any changes
  - Lee Qi will make this all clear

Perfectly fine way to get materials
  - Create class folder on your machine
  - Go to repo
  - Click "Clone or download"
  - Download zip file to class folder

# Accessing Lecture Materials

 Presentations will generally be written in R Markdown. 
 
 You can view the raw .Rmd files in the "presentations" folder
 
 Different presenters may have difference presentation formats, but if html, just open the .html file of the presentation with your favorite browser!

# Project-Oriented Workflows

>This convention guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work” `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Jenny Bryan')`

- All files needed to run your analysis in one folder
  - Nested subfolders as needed
  - **Does not have to be RStudio**

- All analysis written assuming
  - Fresh state
  - Working directory set to project directory

# What's wrong with `setwd`?

.pull-left[
### Workflow

*Personal decisions*

* Choice of IDE

* CaMel or snake_case
  - But seriously, snake_case
  - See [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

* Your lucky coding socks

* **Where the code lives**
]
.pull-right[

### Product

*What the analysis needs*

* The data

* Packages

* Package versions

* Custom functions

* Scripts  to tie it all together

]

## Alternatives to `setwd`

Using RStudio is a simple way around this
  
  - Create .Rproj file in the root directory of your project
  
Alternatively
 
 - Often just open a file in the project directory with R GUI/Atom/Whatever
  
  - use `cd` / `setwd` from the command line/console (not in your script) when you open your analysis


**It's the user's, not the code's, responsibility to make sure the working directory is in the right place**


---

## Use the `here` package

The [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) package helps create platform-proof paths

Uses heuristics involving files like .Rproj, .git, .here to find project root

```{r}
library(here)
```

Builds paths from there

```{r}
here::here("data","my_data.csv")
```

Works on any platform, and inside R Markdown chunks!
